the third (and possibly biggest) project to have been neglected in fall2015

current status:
- http web server  defined via flask (py)
- front-end client defined via android (java)

core feature:
- definition of assets as item instances
- tracking of assets through inventorying
- storage of data through web service

data model:
  subentities: item, location, user 
  entities: asset, inventory
  labels: item category, item manufacturer, location building

issues:  
  client:
  - data fetching extremely inefficient
    (does a refetch of all the data)
  - difficult to maintain a tight coupling of data within its structures
    (hashmap and arraylist)
  - various ui bugs
  
  server:
  - none that i can think of atm
    - i guess i did a pretty good job implementing that :D

future:
- image uploading/capture
