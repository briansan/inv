      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p> In the spring of 2015, I was hired by the Vilanova University Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering to work at their Electronic Support office. There I saw a need for an inventorying system so that we could have a better idea of what assets we owned and where they were. I talked to my boss about it and he had an Android app that kind of got the job done but I assured him that I could do better.  Enter, inv.</p>
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p> inv is really just another inventory management software, or you could call it asset tracking. Either way, you're keeping tabs on the things that you own.</p>
      <h3>Status</h3>
      <p>The full stack of this software is complete. The backend was built using Python-Flask and the frontend was developed under the Android platform. However, there are numerous amounts of functional and user-experience bugs that need to be taken care of. If you could <a href="{{ url_for('support') }}">send your feedback</a> while using this app, it would be much appreciated</p>
