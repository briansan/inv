         just another inventory management system

   - Background

     In the spring of 2015, I was hired by the Vilanova
     University Department of Electrical and Computer 
     Engineering to work at their Electronic Support
     office. There I saw a need for an inventorying system
     so that we could have a better idea of what assets
     we owned and where they were. I talked to my boss
     about it and he had an Android app that kind of got
     the job done but I assured him that I could do better.
     Enter, inv.

   - Introduction
    
     inv is really just another inventory management software,
     or you could call it asset tracking. Either way, you're
     keeping tabs on the things that you own.
  
     The core inv objects are: User, Item, Location, Asset, 
     and Inventory. Assets are instances of an Item that are
     owned by a certain User, and have a home Location.
     An Inventory is a record that confirms that an Asset is
     at some current Location held by some User at some 
     date and time.

   - Current Status
    
     While the backend component of this software is complete 
     enough to utilize the basic functionality of this system,
     there are a few more features that still must be implemented.

     inv is in need of a frontend client which I am currently 
     using the Android platform to implement. There is also a Python
     script that one could use to interface with the backend server.

     Ultimately, I hope to make this whole system deployable 
     through an automated setup script.
